# YoloV3-object-detection

YOLO is a One-Shot learning algorithm to detect objects. It is faster and more accurate than the R-CNN family of algorithms. It was developed by Joseph Redmon and implemented in C through DarkNet.
YOLO was trained on coco dataset. Coco dataset consists of 80 labels such as a person, Cell phone, Bicycles, cars and many more.
